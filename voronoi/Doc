voronoi - compute Voronoi diagram or Delaunay triangulation

SYNOPSIS
	voronoi [-t] <pointfile >outputfile

Voronoi reads the standard input for a set of points in the plane and
writes either the Voronoi diagram or the Delaunay triangulation to
the standard output.  Each input line should consist of two real numbers,
separated by white space, followed by optional text for reference.

If option
	-t 
is present, the Delaunay triangulation is produced. 
Each output line is a triple
	i xi,yi j xj,yj k xk,yk
which are the indices of the three points in a Delaunay triangle
and their coordinates. Points are numbered starting at 0.

If this option is not present, the Voronoi diagram is produced.
Each output line reports one line segment that separates one
point from another, in the format
	cx,cy e1x,e1y e2x,e2y a ...
where cx,cy is the point, e1x,e1y and e2x,e2y are the endpoints of
one of the line segments dividing that point from another point,
a is the area of the triangle formed by the three points, and
the remainder is the original input line for the point cx,cy.
